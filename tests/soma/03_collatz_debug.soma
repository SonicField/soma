) TEST: Collatz with debug
) EXPECT_AL: []

) Initialize context in outer Register
6 !_.current

) Define the step block
{
  (Block start) >print
  !_.                    ) Pop context CellRef from AL, store AT this Register's root
  (After !_.) >print
  (About to print current:) >print
  _.current >toString >print

  ) Push context for the chosen block BEFORE choosing
  _.
  _.current 1 >==
    {
      ) Stop branch: we've printed 1, clean up and terminate
      >drop              ) Drop the context we pushed
      Nil                ) Return Nil to stop chain
    }
    {
      ) Continue branch: compute next value and continue
      >{                 ) Execute a block WITH the context on AL
        !_.              ) Pop context into this nested block's Register

        ) Compute next Collatz value
        _.current
        _.current 2 >% 0 >==
          { 2 >/ }       ) Even: divide by 2
          { 3 >* 1 >+ }  ) Odd: 3n+1
        >choose >^
        !_.current

        ) Push context for next iteration and return block name
        _.
        collatz-step
      }
    }
  >choose >^             ) Choose and execute the selected block
} !collatz-step

_.                       ) Push initial context onto AL
collatz-step >^          ) Execute first iteration
>chain                    ) Chain remaining iterations
