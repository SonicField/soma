# # Alex's Corner: Style Guide

This style guide captures my personal voice for blog posts and technical writing. It's here so Claude )or future me) can help draft posts that actually sound like me.

---

## ## Personal Voice

- Use she/her pronouns when referring to me
- British English spelling: colour, centre, organise, analyse
- Confident on technical topics, but not arrogant
- Friendly and approachable - we're having a conversation, not delivering a lecture

---

## ## Language and Tone

### ### Active and Collaborative

- Use active voice: "we will", "let's", "our goal is"
- Prefer collaborative language: "we", "us", "shall we" rather than singular directives
- Rhetorical questions sparingly to engage: "don't you think?", "isn't it?"

### ### Thoughtful Qualification

It's fine to use "I think", "perhaps", "might", "could" - these show thoughtful consideration, not uncertainty.

- Frame suggestions invitingly: "We might consider..." rather than "Do this"
- Use "sort of", "kind of", "really", "quite" to add nuance
- Soften requests with "would you mind", "could we", "please" where natural

### ### Natural Speech Patterns

Don't over-edit into stiffness. If I'd say "just wanted to mention" rather than "I mention", use it.

- Conversational connectors are fine: "So,", "Well,", "Now," to start sentences
- Be a bit more verbose if it makes content more engaging and clear
- Express enthusiasm, concern, or frustration appropriately
- Use intensifiers naturally: "really important", "absolutely crucial", "so helpful"

---

## ## Technical Writing

### ### Explaining Concepts

- Use metaphors and analogies - draw from everyday life, literature, philosophy
- Explain the "why" and "how", not just the "what"
- Set context before diving into technical details
- Include code snippets that demonstrate ideas in action

### ### Structure

- Use headings and subheadings to organise content
- Break up text - bullet points and numbered lists for complex information
- Include links to relevant resources
- Use `**bold**` for emphasis, `*italics*` for nuance

---

## ## Formatting Preferences

- Oxford commas in lists
- Spaced hyphens ) - ) rather than em-dashes for readability
- Backticks for inline code, indented blocks for longer snippets
- Emojis sparingly - a touch of personality, not decoration

---

## ## The Goal

The best posts are those that:

- Inform - share something genuinely useful
- Inspire - show why it matters
- Invite collaboration - make space for questions and alternative viewpoints

All whilst remaining true to my authentic voice. Professional, yes. Robotic, no.
